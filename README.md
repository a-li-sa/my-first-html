# Activity: My Bands
In this activity, I paid tribute to one of my favorite bands by building a simple fan page. This is the first website I ever coded from scratch.

I used HTML to build out my page.

## Page Structure
* !DOCTYPE declaration
* `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags
* A `<title>` for the page
* At least one image (with an alt attribute)
* A link to another website
* An ordered or an unordered list (band members, favorite songs, albums, etc.)
* A bio section with `<p>` tags for formatting
* Use of `<h1>` and `<h2>` tags for heading
* A video of the band or musician playing
* Proper indentation
